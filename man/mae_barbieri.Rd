\details{
The data comprises of primary localised prostate tumors from two cohorts, the Weill Cornell Medical College (WCMC; New York, NY), and the Uropath (Perth, Australia), which commercially provides banked urological tissues. None of the samples comes from patients who had received prior treatment for prostate cancer.
