\description{
MultiAssayExperiment object containing gene expression (gex), copy 
number alteration (cna), mutations (mut) and immune cell estimates for Barbieri et al.
}
\details{
The data comprises of primary localised prostate tumors from two cohorts, the Weill Cornell Medical College (WCMC; New York, NY), and the Uropath (Perth, Australia), which commercially provides banked urological tissues. None of the samples comes from patients who had received prior treatment for prostate cancer.
