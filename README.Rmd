## Overview 

`curatedPCaData` is a collection of publically available and annotated data resources
concerning prostate cancer. 

## Citation

If you use `curatedPCaData`, please consider adding the following citation (bioRxiv preprint, [direct link here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.01.17.524403v1)):

```

}
```

## Installation

A download link to the latest pre-built `curatedPCaData` tarball is available on the right-side in GitHub under [Releases](https://github.com/Syksy/curatedPCaData/releases).

You can also install `curatedPCaData` from GitHub inside R with: 

```
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Syksy/curatedPCaData")
```

Above may fail depending on the connection stability, as the package is relatively large. In this case it's best to install via the tarball.
To build the package tarball from a cloned git repo, run the following in terminal / command prompt while in the root of the project:

```
R CMD build curatedPCaData
```

It is then possible to install the self-built tarball:

```
R CMD INSTALL curatedPCaData_x.y.z.tar.gz
```

Note that building the package locally will require dependencies to be present for the R installation.

## Usage

### Vignettes

`curatedPCaData` delivers with a number of vignettes displaying the package's generic use as well as summaries and application examples across the prostate cancer datasets provided there-in. The vignette `overview` is intended for gaining a first-line comprehensive view into the package's contents.

The vignettes can be accessed via `vignette(package = "curatedPCaData")` or via `?curatedPCaData` section '_User guides, package vignettes and other documentation_'.

A list of available vignettes, subset to suitable topics:

```{r vignettes, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
tools::getVignetteInfo("curatedPCaData")[, c("Topic", "Title")]
```

### Brief example

Simple example use of curated datasets and 'omics there-in:

```{r example_one, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(curatedPCaData)

curatedPCaData::mae_tcga

curatedPCaData::mae_tcga[["gex.rsem.log"]][1:4, 1:4]

curatedPCaData::mae_tcga[["cna.gistic"]][1:4, 1:4]

MultiAssayExperiment::colData(curatedPCaData::mae_tcga)[1:3, 1:5]

curatedPCaData::mae_taylor

curatedPCaData::mae_sun
```

Note that the prefix `curatedPCaData::` is not currently required, as the setting for `LazyData: true` loads the MAE-objects into the active workspace as the package is loaded. Thus, writing just `mae_tcga` after `library(curatedPCaData)` would work just as well. The `pckgName::object` notation is provided here just for clarity, as different functions may be required to access different functionality of the `MultiAssayExperiment`-objects.

## R Shiny

A basic convenience web interface built with R Shiny for `curatedPCaData` can be launched via:

```
curatedPCaData::shiny()
```

## Known issues

Large R-packages directly installed using ```devtools::install_github``` sometimes result in error:

```
Error in utils::download.file( ...
    download from ' ... ' failed.
``` 

There are few options to fix this:

### Adjusting download options

For Windows users, it's known that setting

```
options(download.file.method = "wininet")
```

may fix this GitHub direct download/install issue. Alternatively, especially in other OSes, the following download method may fix this issue:

```
options(download.file.method = "libcurl")
```

### Direct cloning, building, or downloading and installing the package tarball

A more hands-on approach is to use Git to clone the package and then build and install it using R tools. In your terminal or command prompt, go to a suitable root directory for git repositories:

```
git clone https://github.com/Syksy/curatedPCaData.git
R CMD build curatedPCaData
``` 

alternatively, to speed up package tarball building, add parameter ```--no-build-vignettes```. This will produce a file ```curatedPCaData_x.y.z.tar.gz``` in your active directory, where ```x.y.z``` correspond to the current package version. 

Alternatively, if one does not wish to clone the git and build the tarball, it's also possible to directly download latest release tarball from https://github.com/Syksy/curatedPCaData/releases

After this, the ```curatedPCaData``` R-package tarball can be installed using:

```
R CMD INSTALL curatedPCaData_x.y.z.tar.gz
```

Please note that some dependencies (such as the packages ```MultiAssayExperiment``` and ```S4Vectors```) may produce an error during installation if they are not found for R. In this case these dependencies need to be installed from their respective R package repositories such as CRAN or Bioconductor.
