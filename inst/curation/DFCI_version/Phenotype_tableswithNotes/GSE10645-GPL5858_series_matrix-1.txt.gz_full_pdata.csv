The DASL method labels each sample with a mixture of CY3 and Cy5. Only a single sample is applied to each array.  The scanner measures fluorescence of both Cy3 and Cy5.  This data is contained in the red and grn files for each sample. The bead studio software averages the red and green signals to provide a single value for the expression of a particular probe.","GPL5858","Robert,B.,Jenkins","rjenkins@mayo.edu","Laboratory Medicine and Pathology","Mayo Clinic","200 First Street SW","Rochester","MN","55905","USA","ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/geo/DATA/supplementary/samples/GSM269nnn/GSM269125/GSM269125_1557290041_R007_C010_Grn.idat.gz","ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/geo/DATA/supplementary/samples/GSM269nnn/GSM269125/GSM269125_1557290041_R007_C010_Grn.jpg.gz","ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/geo/DATA/supplementary/samples/GSM269nnn/GSM269125/GSM269125_1557290041_R007_C010_Grn.xml.gz","ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/geo/DATA/supplementary/samples/GSM269nnn/GSM269125/GSM269125_1557290041_R007_C010_Red.idat.gz","ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/geo/DATA/supplementary/samples/GSM269nnn/GSM269125/GSM269125_1557290041_R007_C010_Red.jpg.gz","ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/geo/DATA/supplementary/samples/GSM269nnn/GSM269125/GSM269125_1557290041_R007_C010_Red.xml.gz","502"
