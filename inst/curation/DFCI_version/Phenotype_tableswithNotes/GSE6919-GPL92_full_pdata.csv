Samples (>500 mg) were excised and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen within 30 min of excision and stored at -80°C until extraction of RNA. Metastatic tumor samples were obtained from a warm autopsy program and processed similarly to primary tumors. An H&E stained frozen section of each sample was evaluated by a pathologist, to determine epithelial and stromal content and verify the presence of tumor in the sample. Dissection of the frozen tissue block was performed with the guidance of a marked H & E slide to minimize the presence of host tissue in the metastatic samples. All samples used in the study contained >80% tumor.
