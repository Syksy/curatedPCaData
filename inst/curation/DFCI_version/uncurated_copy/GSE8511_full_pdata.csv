No. 74104) according to the manufacturer's instructions.","cy5","One ug of total RNA was reverse transcripted to cDNA using T7 Promoter Primer and MMLV-RT. Then the cDNA was converted to aRNA using T7 RNA polymerase, which simultaneously amplifies target material and incorporates cyanine 3- or cyanine 5-labeled CTP (Two-Color Microarray-Based Gene Expression Analysis Protocol, Agilent).","9606","825ng of Cy3 and Cy5 labelled aRNA were hybridized competitively for 17 hrs in a 65 C hybridization oven (G2545A, Agilent) set to 10 rpm in a final concentration of 1X GEx Hybridization Buffer HI-RPM, according to the manufacturer's recommnded protocol (Two-Color Microarray-Based Gene Expression Analysis, Agilent). Arrays were washed according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol including the Stabilization and Drying Solution step (Two-Color Microarray-Based Gene Expression Analysis, Agilent).","Arrays were scanned at 5um resolution on an Agilent DNA Microarray Scanner (G2505B, Agilent) using the default settings for 1x44k format two-color arrays.","Localized prostate tumor, Gleason sum: 3+4","","Images were auto gridded, analyzed and data extracted using Agilent Feature Extraction Software (Version 9.1.3.1). Spot values were normalized using the default linear-lowess normalization. Samples M5a and M5b were isolated from the same patient and normalized values were averaged before data analysis.","GPL1708","Laila,M,Poisson","lpoisso1@hfhs.org","Biostatistics and Research Epidemiology","Henry Ford Health Systems","1 Ford Place","Detroit","MI","48202","USA","ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/geo/DATA/supplementary/samples/GSM211nnn/GSM211228/GSM211228.txt.gz","43931"
