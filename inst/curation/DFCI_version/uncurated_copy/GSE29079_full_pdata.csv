Only sections containing between 20-40% normal prostatic epithelial cells were included in the study.","total RNA","AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturerÆs instructions. Briefly, tissue sections were homogenized in 1 ml RLT Plus buffer using TissueLyser (Qiagen). After DNA separation, 1.5 volumes of 100% ethanol were added to the total RNA and the mixture was purified. The quantity and quality of the total RNA was checked using the Nanodrop and Bioanalyzer.","Biotin","Affymetrix WT Sense Target Labeling Assay, follwed by manufacturer's instructions (using 1ug of total RNA)","9606","Affymetrix WT Sense Target Labeling Assay, hybridization done following manufacturer's instructions","Arrays were scanned using the Affymetrix Gene Chip scanner 3000 7G system.","Large-scale gene expression profiles were investigated in 48 normal and 47 prostate tumor tissue samples using Affymetrix GeneChip Exon 1.0 ST microarrays. Gene expression profiles were compared among TMPRSS2-ERG fusion-positive and negative prostate tumors as well as benign samples.","Gene expression profiles were obtained by applying the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) implementation included in the Affymetrix Power Tools (APT). APT creates expression values for 17881 transcript clusters as defined in the meta-probe set files provided by Affymetrix.","GPL5175","Ruprecht,,Kuner","Unit Cancer Genome Research","Molecular Genetics","German Cancer Research Center and National Center of Tumor Diseases","Im Neuenheimer Feld 460","Heidelberg","69120","Germany","ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/geo/DATA/supplementary/samples/GSM720nnn/GSM720597/GSM720597.CEL.gz","17881"
